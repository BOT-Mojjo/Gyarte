When the program starts it will wait untill the user presses M1 to indicate they are ready. When they have, the program will wait 3-5 seconds and then the screen will flash white and the user should press M1 as fast as they can. This will repeat 10 times.
After which the program will wait for the user to be ready, again by wating for a M1 input. Then it will briefly flash a shape in the middle of the screen, which the user will then have to point out in a lineup of different shapes, a triangle, a square, a pentagon, a hexagon, and a circle, by clicking on them. This will repeat until both the colorValue difference and the time it flashes on screen has reached near-zero. Then the program will automaticly close and save the data as "gyarteSubject##################.json"
